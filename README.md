# Bryan Murphy's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a software developer with a passion for creating innovative and efficient solutions to complex problems. With experience in Java, Flutter, and web development, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality software that meets the needs of users and clients alike.

## Projects

Here are some of my notable projects:

### Knock Off Spotify

A music player application that allows users to play, queue, and like songs, as well as create custom playlists. I designed and developed this application using an object-oriented programming foundation, incorporating data structures such as array lists and queues to enable dynamic object storage and retrieval, and utilizing algorithms such as binary search and bubble sort to improve performance and streamline functionality.

### CheckIt

A task tracking and social media mobile app for iOS and Android, developed using Flutter SDK and Dart. I leveraged social media design best practices to conceptualize and implement a responsive and clean UI/UX, and utilized a three-layered architecture pattern to ensure separation of concerns and efficient communication through well-defined interfaces.

### Wrestling Tournament Simulation

A Java application that simulates a wrestling tournament using randomly generated data. The application provides a visual representation of the tournament brackets and allows users to view the progress of each wrestler through the tournament. I utilized various data structures and algorithms, including arrays, lists, and sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, to simulate the tournament and track the progress of each wrestler.

### Sudoku Solver

A Java application that solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. The application provides a command-line interface for inputting and displaying Sudoku puzzles, as well as a visualization of the solving process. I utilized various solving techniques, including elimination and backtracking, to create an efficient and effective solving algorithm.
